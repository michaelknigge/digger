# This is Digger Reloaded, aka UNIX/Linux Digger, however it also works on Windows.

Digger was originally created by Windmill Software in 1983 and released as a
copy-protected, bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the IBM PC. As it requires a
genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern PCs.

In 1998, Andrew Jenner <aj@digger.org>, created Digger Remastered, which runs
on all PCs with CGA or better and plays just like the original. See
http://digger.org for more information about his remake, the history of the
game as well as the history of Windmill Software and their other games.

Later on, Maksym Sobolyev <sobomax@gmail.com>, ported Adnrew's code to run
on Linux/FreeBSD/Windows using SDL library, or on FreeBSD console using
native "VGL" VESA graphics interface. That version is now being actively
developed to move Digger into XXI century.

Furthermore, Michael Knigge <michael.knigge@gmx.de>, did some minor
enhancements, cleaned up the code a little bit, fixed some minor bugs, gave
the "redefine keyboard" dialog a new look and feel and provided an Installer
for Microsoft Windows along with the Appveyor CI scripts.


Some plans for the future releases include:

- 2.0, aka "Digger Reset"
  - [x] SDL 2.0 port
  - [x] fullscreen mode for Windows
  - [x] toggle fullscreen and window mode with Alt-Enter
  - [x] installer for Windows
  - [ ] revised redefine keyboard
  - [ ] make CGA graphics available again (for nostalgia)
  - [ ] further code cleanup (in-progress)
      - [x] move logic into high-level objects
      - [x] remove obsolete command line options
      - [x] 64-bit Windows build
      - [ ] remove obsolete DOS functions (i. e. function s0setupsound() and
            so on)
      - [ ] remove ARM specific code (SDL 2.0 is not available on ARM, so the
            ARM specific code is useless)
      - [ ] remove DIGGER_VERSION and give Digger a regular version number
  - [ ] headless (VNC?) mode
  - [ ] network play for 2 players
  - [ ] screen update framerate that is independent of game perceived speed,
        "sub-pixel" updates

- 3.0, aka "Digger Reloaded"

  - [ ] bigger (open?) game world
  - [ ] MMOG mode
  - [ ] deathmatch mode
  - [ ] new capabilities to the characters (i.e. superpowers), and interactions
        between them (i.e. gradual damage)
  - [ ] few types of diggers: scout, soldier, sniper etc.
  - [ ] monster AI 2.0?
  - [ ] digger AI to make teamplay/deathmatch interesting even in single-player mode
  - [ ] teamplay
